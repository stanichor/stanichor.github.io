title: "A Psychometric Analysis of Tailcalled's Gender Satisfaction Survey"

[Tailcalled](https://surveyanon.wordpress.com/) ran a "Gender satisfaction and other things" survey, so I decided to analyze the data. The responses came from 185 cis men recruited on Prolific. 

## Factor Structure

I was able to extract 9 factors: 
- Affective Gender Identity
- BDSM Interest
- Masculine Gender Norm Endorsement
- Masculine Gender Role Insecurity
- Gender Dysphoria
- Homosexuality
- Perceived Female Advantage
- Mental Illness
- Autogynephilia

### Factor 1: Affective Gender Identity

  <summary>Body sex and gender satisfaction (0.72)</summary>
  <div style="margin-left: 15px; border: 1px solid #ccc; padding: 10px; background-color: #f9f9f9;">
    Imagine you were magically permanently transformed into a woman, with your broad psychological traits like sexuality, interests, personality and so on were shifted to become female-typical, rather than staying the same as they already were? That is, how would you feel about the prospect of becoming fully a woman? Note that you should answer based on how the CURRENT you feels about it prospectively, not about how the TRANSFORMED you would feel about it retrospectively.
    <ul style="margin-bottom: 0;">
      <li>Quite or very good for me</li>
      <li>Somewhat good for me</li>
      <li>Not so bad for me</li>

      <li>Quite bad for me</li>
      <li>Very bad for me</li>

This factor contained items about wanting to be a woman. Among the emotions one might experience if they were to magically wake up as a woman, comfort (which loaded positively) and disgust (which loaded negatively) had the strongest loadings. Interestingly, sexual arousal at the idea of sex with tomboyish/masculine women also loaded positively on this factor.

This scale has very high reliability across most levels of affective gender identity, due to many items with high loadings.

This factor contained items about sexual interest in BDSM-related activities. Notably, both dominance-themed items and submission-themed items had *very* strong loadings.

<div style="text-align: center;">
    <figure>
        <img src="/assets/images/gender-satisfaction/factor-1-tailcalled-diagram.png" width="1000" alt="Alt text">
    </figure>
</div>

This scale has high reliability for people with average and high interest in BDSM, it has low reliability for those with low interest in BDSM. Part of this is due to the number of respondents who, as far as the scale can tell, had essentially zero interest in BDSM. But, if we compare this scale to [the scale formed from Aella's Kink Survey](https://stanichor.net/kink-factor-analysis/#bdsm), we see that another issue is the limited number of items; increasing the number of items would likely improve reliability, even taking into account the low interest in BDSM.

This factor contained items endorsing masculine gender norms, expressing pride or comfort in being male, and claiming being a man was a core part of one's identity. Belief in negative stereotypes of women (e.g., stereotypes about women being prone to overthinking or generating unnecessary drama) loaded positively on this factor, along with the belief that men and women have large psychological differences. The belief that one can choose their gender loaded negatively.

This scale had moderate reliability for the upper end of the distribution and atrocious reliability for the lower end. This isn't surprising given that the scale consists of three items, and also, many respondents simply are not gay.

### Factor 7: Perceived Female Advantage
<details>
  <summary>Sexual assault worries (0.52)</summary>
  <div style="margin-left: 15px; border: 1px solid #ccc; padding: 10px; background-color: #f9f9f9;">
    Women face risks of various types of sexual assault. Men might grope them, rape them, spike their drinks, and so on. Most people obviously see that as bad, but I've seen a lot of variation in *how* bad they see it, from life-threatening to something you can just shrug off. In net, if you were a woman, do you think these factors would be good or bad for you?
    <ul style="margin-bottom: 0;">
      <li>This would benefit me a lot as a woman</li>
      <li>This would benefit me somewhat as woman</li>

  <summary>Toughness (0.52)</summary>
  <div style="margin-left: 15px; border: 1px solid #ccc; padding: 10px; background-color: #f9f9f9;">
    Some places consider it important for men to be tough, to hide their feelings and be ready to fight. If you are a softie, then this may feel hard to deal with, while if you are naturally tough and wild, maybe you enjoy it; and if you don't live in a place where these values exist, maybe you don't notice it/think about it much. In net, to what extent do you find expectations of toughness like this to harm you as a man?
    <ul style="margin-bottom: 0;">
      <li>This benefits me a lot as a man</li>
      <li>This benefits me somewhat as man</li>

  <summary>Attractiveness competition (0.51)</summary>
  <div style="margin-left: 15px; border: 1px solid #ccc; padding: 10px; background-color: #f9f9f9;">
    It's commonly thought that women are more judged about how attractive they are, and that this attractiveness particularly depends on being skinny and youthful-looking. This might be bad for you if you don't like putting effort into your appearance, or good for you if e.g. you are skinny and like being pretty. In net, if you were a woman, do you think these factors would be good or bad for you?
    <ul style="margin-bottom: 0;">
      <li>This would benefit me a lot as a woman</li>
      <li>This would benefit me somewhat as woman</li>
      <li>This doesn't have much net effect on me</li>

<details>
  <summary>Physical vulnerability (0.51)</summary>
  <div style="margin-left: 15px; border: 1px solid #ccc; padding: 10px; background-color: #f9f9f9;">
    Most women are much weaker and smaller than most men. The typical man could totally and brutally beat up the typical woman. As such, women spent their life surrounded by people who, simply put, could totally physically dominate them, at least until society intervenes to defend them. This can lead to fear and anxiety, and is obviously potentially dangerous. Obviously most would feel that this is bad, but again how bad they find it can vary. In net, if you were a woman, do you think these factors would be good or bad for you?
    <ul style="margin-bottom: 0;">
      <li>This would benefit me a lot as a woman</li>
      <li>This would benefit me somewhat as woman</li>
      <li>This doesn't have much net effect on me</li>

  <summary>Sociosexual attention (0.50)</summary>
  <div style="margin-left: 15px; border: 1px solid #ccc; padding: 10px; background-color: #f9f9f9;">
    A lot of men really want to have sex with women, and therefore they often stare at women, ask them out at bars, and so on. An advantage of this is that women can obtain a lot of favors from men, but a disadvantage may be that the attention is annoying. In net, if you were a woman, do you think these factors would be good or bad for you
    <ul style="margin-bottom: 0;">
      <li>This would benefit me a lot as a woman</li>

    In most places, women are expected to wear makeup, to keep up with fashions, to have long hair, and sometimes also to wear high heels; more generally to have a "feminine" presentation. In net, if you were a woman, do you think this expectation would be good or bad for you?

  <summary>Female childcare (0.42)</summary>
  <div style="margin-left: 15px; border: 1px solid #ccc; padding: 10px; background-color: #f9f9f9;">
    Women are especially expected to want children, to do most of the childcare, and to prioritize children over career. For those who like it, this can mean the opportunity to live as a stay-at-home mother, who really keeps her children well, and to have very close relationships with their children. But for those who dislike it, it can be a large burden to face. In net, if you were a woman, do you think this expectation would be good or bad for you?

  <summary>Periods (0.36)</summary>
  <div style="margin-left: 15px; border: 1px solid #ccc; padding: 10px; background-color: #f9f9f9;">
    Women have monthly periods, where they bleed and can have cramps and even emotional fluctuations. This often requires buying tampons/pads to not bleed over their underwear, and they typically have to deal with periods while also engaging in other tasks. Obviously most find this bad, but the extent to which they can deal with it seems to vary. In net, if you were a woman, do you think these factors would be good or bad for you?

<div style="height: 20px;"></div> <!-- Spacer element -->
While most of the items load positively on this factor are about various aspects of womanhood being benefits, the highest positively loading item was an aspect of manhood—the expectations of toughness—being a benefit. I'm unsure why this item loads (positively) on this factor. Another interesting item was the belief that there are more than two genders, which loaded negatively on this factor. It's possible that this belief correlates with social liberalism, which in turn correlates with a general belief that women have things pretty rough.

This scale had moderate reliability across the distribution. Given the number of items, along with the varying difficulties, the only problem seems to be the relatively low loadings of the items. I would suggest adding items that are more direct about asking which gender has it better, but the item that asks that question directly, "Do you feel men or women have it easier in life?", has a relatively low loading, even for the scale.

This scale had very high reliability for average-to-high levels of autogynephilia, but low reliability for low levels of autogynephilia. As with several previous scales, this likely reflects the low prevalence of autogynephilia in the sample. This factor has similar items to the [genderplay factor](https://stanichor.net/kink-factor-analysis/#genderplay) in Aella's Kink Survey. It may be worth adding items from that survey, especially the item about being submissive in sexual scenarios, which had higher levels of endorsement than other items of the genderplay factor.

## Factor Interactions

### Factor Correlation Matrix 

In the following correlation matrix, each cell displays the estimated Pearson correlation coefficient in large font, with the 94% credible interval in smaller font. A notable correlation cluster contains affective gender identity, gender dysphoria, and autogynephilia, which show substantial intercorrelations, reflecting their common association with aspects of identifying as female.

</div>

### Partial Correlation Matrix

The partial correlation between two variables is their correlation after eliminating the influence of a third variable (or set of variables). [Inverting a covariance matrix](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Covariance_matrix#Inverse_of_the_covariance_matrix) yields its precision matrix, from which partial correlations and partial variances can be extracted. The resulting partial correlations are those between two variables while controlling for the influence of *every other* variable. The resulting partial variances reflect how much variance remains unexplained by all the other variables.

<div style="text-align: center;">
    <figure>
        <img src="/assets/images/gender-satisfaction/partial-factor-corr.png" width="1000" alt="Alt text">
    </figure>
</div>

Compared to the correlation matrix, the partial correlation matrix has much smaller correlations. This suggests that the Markov network describing the interaction between the factors is sparser than it appears when examining the raw correlation matrix.

The BDSM Interest factor has notable partial correlations with: 
- Homosexuality (+.23)
- Autogynephilia (+.22)
- Masculine Gender Norm Endorsement (+.19)
- Masculine Gender Role Insecurity (+.18)

Given that the BDSM Interest, Homosexuality, and Autogynephilia factors all consist of questions about sexual arousal, there may be a general sexual arousal (horniness) factor that links them all together. That would also explain the partial correlation between BDSM Interest and Masculine Gender Norm Endorsement. The association between BDSM Interest and Masculine Gender Role Insecurity remains unclear; it may be noise.

Deriving a Markov network from the remaining variables yields the following structure:
