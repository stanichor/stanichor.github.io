On the internet, Rust is often considered *the* "trans (woman) programming language". I decided to use the [Stack Overflow Survey data](https://survey.stackoverflow.co/) to see if this belief matches reality. The following tables rank languages by what percentage of users belong to each of the chosen groups. The ranks in the following tables are based on the [smoothed](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Additive_smoothing) proportions while the percentages shown are un-smoothed.

## Conclusion

Looking at the evidence, Rust is relatively popular among trans women (although it looks like APL is more popular). Another interesting pattern is that cis women are more likely to use languages used in statistics and scientific computing (e.g, R, SAS, MATLAB).
