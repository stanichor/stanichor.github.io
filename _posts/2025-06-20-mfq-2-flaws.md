The Moral Foundations Questionnaire-2 (MFQ-2) was designed to measure moral attitudes along six theorized dimensions: Care, Equality, Proportionality, Loyalty, Authority, and Purity. The MFQ-2 builds on the original MFQ and attempts to broaden moral measurement across cultures. However, close inspection of the factor loadings reported in its 2022 validation study[^1] reveals substantial psychometric weaknesses.

## Factor Loadings: Weak and Cross-Loaded Items

### Weak Loadings

A factor loading indicates how strongly an item correlates with the underlying latent variable—the factor the item is intended to measure. In practice, loadings below 0.40 are often considered too weak to justify inclusion[^2]. Yet across the MFQ-2:

- **Equality** includes one item below 0.40.
- **Proportionality** includes two.
- **Loyalty** includes three—one of which loads at *0.10*.
- **Authority** includes two.
- **Purity** includes three.

Weak factor loadings are not just a minor technical issue. Low-loading items add noise to any latent variable estimation, undermining construct validity. If a researcher wants to correlate "Loyalty" with political identity, but the Loyalty factor is mostly noise, then their results will be attenuated or misleading.

### Cross-Loadings

Several items load more strongly on unintended factors, which is also grounds for exclusion[^2]. For example:

- “It makes me happy when people are recognized on their merits” loads more on Care and Authority than Proportionality.
- “Everyone should feel proud when a person in their community wins in an international competition” loads more on Authority than Loyalty.
- "I think the human body should be treated like a temple, housing something sacred within." loads more strongly on Authority than Purity.
- “I believe the strength of a sports team comes from the loyalty of its members to each other” loads more on Proportionality, Care, and Authority than Loyalty.

Such results suggest the MFQ-2’s factors are not well-isolated psychological constructs.

## Problematic Item Content

Some MFQ-2 factors appear to measure specific political or cultural values that are rather difference from the abstract moral principles they purport to measure:

- The Equality items do not measure general egalitarian sentiment, but instead endorse extreme resource equalization (e.g., “same income,” “same quantity of resources”).
- The Proportionality items suggest that compensation should be tied to effort rather than outcome—an economically illiterate position.
- The Loyalty items focus narrowly on patriotism and national identity, neglecting loyalty to friends, families, or institutions.


## Implications for Research

Consider [a recent study](https://www.sciencedirect.com/science/article/pii/S0160289625000339) correlating MFQ-2 scores with IQ. Because MFQ-2 conflates Equality with full income redistribution, high-IQ individuals are misrepresented as less morally egalitarian. And because Loyalty is narrowly nationalistic, high-IQ individuals are characterized as disloyal, when they may just be less attached to their national identity.

In short, researchers using the MFQ-2 may not be measuring what they think they are measuring.
